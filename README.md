GAsP is designed to generate testable hypotheses in seconds. It retrieves up to five papers from NASA Space Biology publications, extracts key summary information and research gaps, and then automatically generates a clear, actionable hypothesis. 1) AI-powered Search & Summarization GAsP leverages LLMs to accelerate literature exploration through retrieval and intelligent summarization, delivering true speed. Each paper is summarized across eight structured categories, including data, methodology, conditions, models, and results, enabling researchers to quickly grasp the core content. 2) LLM-based Research Gap Generation The system automatically identifies research gaps based on predefined agents (Methodological Analyst, Conceptual Analyst, Experimental Analyst), uncovering gaps that human researchers might overlook. 3) LLM-based Hypothesis Generation Selected research gaps are transformed into concrete, testable hypotheses, ready for experimental design. GAsP drastically reduces the time required for hypothesis generation. While conventional methods can take over nine hours, GAsP enables researchers to complete the process in just a few minutes. This efficiency allows scientists to focus more on experimental work and analysis, moving seamlessly from keywords to Hypotheses, and accelerating the overall research process.([Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FlGfohdK5_PTNShhhBPBwXhRDZfBd4FB/edit?amp%3Bouid=109074628458883513610&amp%3Bamp%3Brtpof=true&amp%3Bamp%3Bsd=true&amp%3Bslide=id.p5&slide=id.p5#slide=id.p5))
